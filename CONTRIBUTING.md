# Contribution

## Process

Before spending time and effort in making changes to the library, please open an issue first explaining the proposed change 
and indicate that you would be happy to implement/fix the issue. Once the utility of the addition is discussed and verified,
you're welcome to proceed.

Fork [plotly](https://igiagkiozis.github.io/plotly/) to your own account and checkout the `dev` branch. Once the bug/feature is complete, make sure you update 
appropriately the [change log](CHANGELOG.md). 

For change-log updates please use previous entries as reference, namely classify
the nature of the change, e.g. fixed, changed, added etc., and a brief description. The entry in the change-log that should be
used for the update will always be marked with YEAR-XX-XX, e.g. 2020-XX-XX.

Make a pull request with our changes directly to the `dev` branch. Please note, pull requests to the `master` branch will not
be considered. The `master` branch is reserved for release. Also, include a description of our changes as documented in the 
[change-log](CHANGELOG.md); just copy paste these additions in the pull request description. Wait for one of the reviewers 
to look at your code and either merge it or give feedback which you should adapt to.

# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
