# Plotly for Rust

A plotting library for Rust based on [Plotly JS](https://plot.ly/javascript/).

## Disclaimer

All versions of this library prior to `1.0.0` should be considered experimental and as such the 
library interface can and will change without notice. However, even in this early stage of development, 
the library can be used for data analysis [see examples](examples/example_plots.rs).


## Usage

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
plotly = "0.2.0"
```
